The University’s Distance Learning policy is available from

Learning Courses:
 For reporting purposes, an absence in a distance learning course is operationally defined as a missed online

 Distance learning courses must require an initial online submission within the session drop/add
 period. Students who do not submit may be dropped from the roster.
 The University Class Attendance Policy states the following: Students are expected to attend all of their
scheduled classes as work at the university level requires regular attendance and preparation. Coastal
Carolina University realizes that there are valid circumstances under which a student may be absent from
class. Professors are expected to excuse these absences, although documentation verifying the validity of the
absence may be required. Students are responsible for working out any class requirements with their
professors. [A list of administratively excused absences is available via the Class Attendance policy
webpage.]
Instructional Attendance Policies
 “Students’ Responsibilities - Enrollment in a course obligates the student not only to prompt completion of all
work assigned, but also to punctual and regular attendance, and to participation in whatever class discussion
may occur. It is the student's responsibility to stay informed of all assignments, due dates and exams.
Absences, whether excused or unexcused, do not absolve the student from this responsibility.”
 “Missed Coursework – absences, excused or unexcused, do not absolve students from the responsibility of
completing all assigned work promptly. Students who miss assignments, announced quizzes or other
coursework due to excused absences will be allowed to make up the work in a manner deemed appropriate by
the instructor (as stated in the course syllabus). It will be the responsibility of the student to contact the
instructor and make arrangements at the convenience of the instructor. The instructor is not obligated to allow
a student to make up work missed due to an unexcused absence.”
 “Instructor-Excused Absences – the instructor will determine whether absences other than those defined …
should be excused or unexcused….”
